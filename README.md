ðŸ§  AI Reflection:

1. 2-3 prompts you asked AI

    First prompt: 
        
    "Can you code review the code I have so far?"

    Second prompt: 
        
    I'm having trouble understanding how to randomly choose a color from the three given. Without showing me code, can you explain how that works?


2. A sentence or two on how AI helped (debugging, design, etc.)

    The AI bot I used helped me code review the code I had, and when something wasn't working the way I wanted it to, it helped me see what issues I had in my code. I also used it as a learning opportunity to see how I could improve the code I made. 

3. One thing you figured out on your own

    One thing I figured out on my own was how to structure my logic inside a component. I created the randomColorSwatch() function and started modifying it as I added each new feature.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
